# ChatITAPI
A simple API that allow St. Olaf student and faculty to ask IT related question, UI interface will be updated soon. This repository is currently consist of a data pipeline for scraping from all subpages in the St. Olaf IT website and ingested them into an Google Cloud Storage bucket, which will be ingested later into a Pinecone Vector Index, and a simple Flask API that utlized Llama-index for querying the result from the vector database to answer various questions from users.
